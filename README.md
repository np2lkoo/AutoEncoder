AutoEncoder
===========

##Overview

This is a simple AutoEncoder program without using "Deep Lerning FrameWork". 
(But use only sklearn to get MNIST DATA.)

I'm studying autoencoder program in python since July 2016.
I wanted to create a program that does not use a deep learning framework. 
Because using the framework, we will not know the internal operation.
I wanted to do a variety of experiments in this program.

This program was created to cut and paste from meny tutorials and samples.
Only report part was made by myself (and it's so complicated).

## Description

  1. This program not use "Deep Lerning FrameWork".
  1. This program operates comfortable alone CPU (not require GPU).
    (This program will give priority to speed, it has been at the expense of accuracy.)
  1. The experimental results are reported in simple format with matplotlib.
  1. We can improve this program easily because it's a very simple.
  1. Example program encode/decode MNIST data, but core autoencoder class can use any purpose.

## Requirement
  * This program work at python 2 and 3.
  * I checked on Python 2.1.7 and 3.5.2.

  libraly is following
 * numpy 1.11.1
 * scipy 0.18.0
 * sklearn 0.17.1
 * PIL 2.0 / Pillow 3.3.1
 * matplotlib 1.5.3
 * pandas 0.18.1
 * (and jupyter)


## Usage
    python  Experiment.py

  or run on Jupyter or Python IDE.
  This program has not main() because I often execute this program on Jupyter Notebook.
  Jupyter Notebook is very convenient to experiment or have a try.

  Prease run Experiment.py program, and it's prepare MNIST DATA and lern them and 
  save result data, save report image and show report results on your display.
