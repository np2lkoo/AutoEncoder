AutoEncoder
===========

##Overview

This is a simple AutoEncoder program without using "Deep Learning FrameWork". 
(But use only sklearn to get MNIST DATA.)

I've been studying an autoencoder program in python since July 2016. 
I wanted to create a program that does not use a deep learning framework. 
Because using the framework, we will not know the internal operation.
I wanted to do a variety of experiments in this program.

This program was created to cut and paste from many tutorials and samples.
Only report part was made by myself (and it's so complicated).

## Description

  1. This program not use "Deep Learning FrameWork".
  1. This program operates comfortable alone CPU (not require GPU).
    (This program will give priority to speed, it has been at the expense of accuracy.)
  1. The experimental results are reported in the simple format with matplotlib.
  1. We can improve this program easily because it's a very simple.
  1. Example program encode/decode MNIST data, but core autoencoder class can use any purpose.

## Requirement
  * This program work at 3.11.x
  * I am checking on Python 3.11.x Now!

  libraly is following
 * numpy 2.0.1
 * scipy 1.14.0
 * sklearn 0.17.1 -> scikit-learn 1.5.1
 * Pillow 10.4.0
 * matplotlib 3.9.1.post1
 * pandas 2.2.2
 * (and jupyter???)


## Usage
    python  Experiment.py

  or run on Jupyter or Python IDE.
  This program has not main() because I often execute this program on Jupyter Notebook.
  Jupyter Notebook is very convenient to experiment or have a try.

  Please run Experiment.py program, and it's prepared MNIST DATA and learn them and 
  save the results data, save the report image and show report of results on your display.
